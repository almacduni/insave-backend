values  (137, 'The COVID-19 outbreak made 2020 an unusual year for the typically cyclical semiconductor industry. The normally healthy Q2 growth was sidelined by the pandemic uncertainties, which tightened spending and slowed production. Q3 bounced back as semi companies responded to the demand surge tied to the work and learn from home shifts, but those trends could lose steam in 2021 as the vaccines roll out. Chart: Price return of the iShares PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) vs. the tech sector (NYSEARCA:XLK) and S&P 500 in 2020. 2021 forecast: The semiconductor industry forecast remains largely positive based on multiple growth drivers, including the improving global GDP growth, strong 5G base station deployments, increased 5G smartphone penetration, and the continued automotive market recovery. In a recent note, J.P. Morgan forecast 8-10% overall industry growth and 15-18% earnings growth. Semi stocks are expected to have a 15-20% upside in the next 18-20 months. The firm named Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) as its top pick due in part to its "underappreciated diversification (with datacenter networking/storage accounting for ~25% of revenues)." Semiconductor equipment forecast: The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is expected to reach $71.9B in 2021, up from the $68.9B in 2020, according to SEMI data. J.P. Morgan selected KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) as its top semiconductor equipment pick for 2021. Other top players include Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), and ASML (NASDAQ:ASML). The first three names have a strong China exposure and are sensitive to any related news like the U.S. sanctions against SMIC, China''s largest chipmaker. Foundry forecast: TrendForce estimates that global foundry revenue ended 2020 at about $84.6B, up 24% Y/Y for the highest growth rate in nearly 10 years. For 2021, the research firm expects global foundry revenue to increase 6% to a new record high. The global foundry market is dominated by TSMC (NYSE:TSM) at a 54% share and Samsung (OTC:SSNNF,OTC:SSNLF), which is expected to grow its share from 17% to 18% in 2021. UMC (NYSE:UMC) is expected to hold steady at a 7% share, while SMIC will lose a percentage point due to the U.S. actions. Strong orders from AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) for TSMC''s 7nm process node and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for Samsung''s 7/5nm nodes are expected to continue through Q2 2021. Related: The global PC market hit a 10 year shipment high in Q3 due to the pandemic-related demand boom, and IDC predicts PC demand will increase 1.4% in 2021.'),

The Wall Street Journal reports an average price hike of 3.3% from about 70 drug manufacturers in the new year, citing the data from software maker from Rx Savings Solutions. In comparison, 50% fewer products from more than 60 companies saw an average increase of 5.8% in prices in 2020. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) have led the pack to raise the prices by 5% or less, with the former including over 200 products in the list, compared to more than a dozen drugs selected by the latter. Noting that the hike was necessary to fund research, a spokeswoman from the leading COVID-19 vaccine maker said that the adjustment at 1.3% for all products in the portfolio was in line with inflation. Meanwhile, a spokesperson from Sanofi has stated that none of its price increases will exceed the expected growth of U.S. healthcare spending at 5.1%. According to the analysis, with a price increase of 31% for its hypertension therapy, Dutoprol, ADVANZ PHARMA (OTCPK:CXRXF) has affected the sharpest price increase. The generics drugmaker, Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA), and Canada-based Bausch Health (NYSE:BHC) have joined in with a price hike for about 15 and 40 drugs in their portfolios, respectively. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) has introduced an average price increase of 2.6% across the portfolio, according to a company spokesperson.

        (152, 'While the S&P 500 gained 18% in 2020 even with the pressures of the pandemic, most of the gains came from a handful of humongous tech companies. You recognize the names — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia — that have dominated the stock movers headlines. But as COVID-19 vaccines roll out, the market should continue to broaden as investors shift their focus on company fundamentals, writes Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jonathan Coleman. Specifically, he sees optimism for small and mid-cap equities in 2021 because the disconnect between stock performance and company fundamentals that occurred in 2020 isn''t sustainable, Coleman contends. During 2020, the stocks of money-losing companies outperformed the stocks of those that made money by a ratio of two to one, with a similar dynamic occurring in mid-cap stocks, he said. Part of that resulted from investors focusing on stocks that they believed might benefit from the pandemic, even if they continued to lose money. They also avoided stocks that they thought might see near-term earnings damage from COVID-19 and ignored their longer-term growth potential. The resurgence of individual investors trading on low-cost investment platforms like Robinhoood "exacerbated momentum-driven, rather than fundamentals-driven, moves" in parts of the equity markets, Coleman writes. "In the third quarter we saw signs this dynamic may be shifting, as profitable, moderately valued companies performed better on a relative basis even if they still lagged the broader market," he said. He expects a greater focus on fundamentals on a wider range of companies with sustainable revenue and earnings growth potential. Investors should look for companies with "strong and durable competitive advantages, high returns on invested capital and strong free cash flows." In a post-COVID world, consumers will continue to embrace online shopping and e-commerce is likely to grow as a share of total consumer spending, Coleman writes. While it may not be reflected in near-term stock prices, companies that innovate to adapt to the new post-COVID environment should ultimately be rewarded by investors, he said.

During 2020, the stocks of money-losing companies outperformed the stocks of those that made money by a ratio of two to one, with a similar dynamic occurring in mid-cap stocks, he said. Part of that resulted from investors focusing on stocks that they believed might benefit from the pandemic, even if they continued to lose money. They also avoided stocks that they thought might see near-term earnings damage from COVID-19 and ignored their longer-term growth potential.

"In the third quarter we saw signs this dynamic may be shifting, as profitable, moderately valued companies performed better on a relative basis even if they still lagged the broader market," he said.

While Moderna is still up sharply for the year, its down nearly 40% from its high of $169.86 hit in the first week of December. MRNA is moving into an important technical level after the recent selloff. Last week it moved just below its 50-day simple moving average, before bouncing back above. It had crossed above the 50-day and 100-day in early November when the vaccine rally arrived. It is currently below the 50-day SMA of $109.05 and the relative strength index is above oversold, still, at 40.91. But Moderna is overvalued at present and likely to tumble due to insider sales, Seeking Alpha Contributor Shock Exchange writes. “At the end of the day, the U.S. will likely not want to rely on only two vaccine manufacturers. I expect policy makers to make a concerted effort to get supply from AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and others. Once more suppliers enter the market for vaccines, there could be fewer sales to go around for Moderna and Pfizer.”'),

"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them - specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence," the company says. The new move came in particular response to two tweets the president sent today. "In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action," Twitter says. Trump''s tweets today - saying his voters would "not be disrespected or treated unfairly" and that he would not be attending the inauguration - "must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks," the company says. The move follows Facebook''s (NASDAQ:FB) decision yesterday to suspend Trump''s activity indefinitely (and at least for the remaining days through the inauguration of Joe Biden). Twitter''s 12-hour suspension looked light in the face of Facebook''s decision, and Trump''s return to the Twitter''s platform today drew heavy attention. Meanwhile, Parler - the alternative social media network favored by conservatives and Trump supporters, who praise it for a lack of moderation - is facing a ban from Apple''s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store. Apple has given Parler 24 hours to produce a moderation policy or have its app removed. Updated 6:43 p.m.: Twitter stock is down 1.9% after hours; the company is faced with losing one of its most heavily engaged accounts in history. Updated 8:44 p.m.: Trump tried tweeting from the presidency''s official handle - the government-owned @POTUS account - but Twitter pulled the tweets almost immediately. He accused Twitter of coordinating with enemies to silence him, and said "we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future."
